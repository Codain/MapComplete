 type_node 
===========





This is a priviliged meta_layer which exports _every_ point in OSM. This only works if zoomed below the point that the full tile is loaded (and not loaded via Overpass). Note that this point will also contain a property `parent_ways` which contains all the ways this node is part of as a list. This is mainly used for extremely specialized themes, which do advanced conflations. Expert use only.
