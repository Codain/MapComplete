  - <img src='../warning.svg' height='1rem'/> This layer is loaded from an external source, namely `https://betadata.grbosm.site/grb?bbox={x_min},{y_min},{x_max},{y_max}`
  - This layer will automatically load  [osm-buildings](./osm-buildings.md)  into the layout as it depends on it:  a tagrendering needs this layer (Import-button)
  - This layer will automatically load  [type_node](./type_node.md)  into the layout as it depends on it:  a tagrendering needs this layer (Import-button)
  - This layer will automatically load  [osm-buildings](./osm-buildings.md)  into the layout as it depends on it:  A calculated tag loads features from this layer (calculatedTag[0] which calculates the value for _overlaps_with_buildings)
  - This layer will automatically load  [generic_osm_object](./generic_osm_object.md)  into the layout as it depends on it:  A calculated tag loads features from this layer (calculatedTag[18] which calculates the value for _intersects_with_other_features)

 Basic tags for this layer 
---------------------------



Elements must have the all of following tags to be shown on this layer:



  - HUISNR~^..*$
  - man_made!~^mast$




 Supported attributes 
----------------------





### Import-button 



_This tagrendering has no question and is thus read-only_





  - **{conflate_button(osm-buildings,building=$_target_building_type; source:geometry:date=$_grb_date; source:geometry:ref=$_grb_ref; addr:street=$addr:street; addr:housenumber=$addr:housenumber, Replace the geometry in OpenStreetMap and add the address,,_osm_obj:id)}** corresponds with _overlap_percentage>50&_reverse_overlap_percentage>50&_overlaps_with!~^$&addr:street~^..*$&addr:housenumber~^..*$&addr:street!=&addr:housenumber!=
  - **{conflate_button(osm-buildings,building=$_target_building_type; source:geometry:date=$_grb_date; source:geometry:ref=$_grb_ref, Replace the geometry in OpenStreetMap,,_osm_obj:id)}** corresponds with _overlap_percentage>50&_reverse_overlap_percentage>50&_overlaps_with!~^$




### Building info 



_This tagrendering has no question and is thus read-only_





### overlapping building address 



_This tagrendering has no question and is thus read-only_





  - **The overlapping openstreetmap-building has address {_osm_obj:addr:street} {_osm_obj:addr:housenumber}** corresponds with _osm_obj:addr:street~^..*$&_osm_obj:addr:housenumber~^..*$
  - **The overlapping building only has a street known: {_osm_obj:addr:street}** corresponds with _osm_obj:addr:street~^..*$
  - **The overlapping building only has a housenumber known: {_osm_obj:addr:housenumber}** corresponds with _osm_obj:addr:housenumber~^..*$
  - **No overlapping OpenStreetMap-building found** corresponds with 




### grb_address_diff 



_This tagrendering has no question and is thus read-only_





### overlapping building type 



_This tagrendering has no question and is thus read-only_





### apply-id 



_This tagrendering has no question and is thus read-only_





### apply-building-type 



_This tagrendering has no question and is thus read-only_
